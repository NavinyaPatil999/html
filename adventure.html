    <h2>Did You Know...?</h2>

    <p>Get ready for some amazing tidbits from the animal kingdom!</p>

    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Sharks:</strong></dt>
        <dd>Sharks don't have bones! Their skeletons are made of cartilage, the same flexible tissue found in your nose and ears. This helps them move incredibly fast through the water.</dd>

        <dt><strong>Octopuses:</strong></dt>
        <dd>An octopus has three hearts! Two pump blood through its gills, and the third circulates blood to the rest of its body. They also have blue blood because it contains copper.</dd>

        <dt><strong>Snails:</strong></dt>
        <dd>A snail can sleep for three years! They do this when the weather is too hot or dry to survive outside, retreating into their shells for a long nap.</dd>

        <dt><strong>Penguins:</strong></dt>
        <dd>Penguins can drink saltwater! They have a special gland above their eyes that filters out the salt from the water they ingest, allowing them to excrete it through their beaks.</dd>

        <dt><strong>Butterflies:</strong></dt>
        <dd>Butterflies taste with their feet! Their tiny sensors allow them to "taste" whether a leaf is a good place to lay their eggs.</dd>

        <dt><strong>Elephants:</strong></dt>
        <dd>Elephants are the only animals that can't jump. While they're incredibly strong, their leg muscles and ankle structures aren't designed for jumping.</dd>
